      <h3>Why Iâ€™m Focusing on Blue Team Automation</h3>
      <p><strong>Published:</strong> July 14, 2025</p>
      <p>Cybersecurity is evolving rapidly, and so are the threats organizations face daily. After spending time studying SOC operations, alert triage, and incident response workflows, I noticed one thing in common: much of the work can be automated. That realization is what led me to pursue Blue Team Automation.</p>
      <p>I believe that the future of effective cybersecurity lies in empowering defenders with better tools. Blue Team Automation is about writing scripts, building dashboards, and creating smart systems that handle repetitive tasks â€” letting analysts focus on what matters most: making decisions and staying ahead of threats.</p>
      <p>My goal is to build tools that simplify log analysis, enrich alerts with context, and present security insights in a meaningful way. I've already started exploring this through projects like my KPI dashboard and early work on a SOC bot. As I continue learning, I plan to document my process openly and share tools that could help other analysts do their jobs more efficiently.</p>
      <p>This is just the beginning. If you're also passionate about defensive security and automation, letâ€™s connect!</p>
